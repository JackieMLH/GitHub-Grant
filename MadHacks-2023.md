# MadHacks 2023 Summary

March 4th - 5th, 2023
University of Wisconsin - Madison
Madison, WI, USA

## Event Summary

MadHacks 2023 was a revival of Wisconsin's premier hackahon. As always, the event was hosted on the UW-Madison campus, and organized by UW undergraduates.

MadHacks 2023 was lucky to have really enthusiastic, involved sponsors. The company-specific prize tracks were really diverse, and gave students with a wide range of specialties a good target to shoot for.

Amid all the hacking, we put on workshops on web scraping and how to present a project, as well as well as a talk on the world of open source. MLH organized two additonal events: a game of CTF where hackers were able to learn about software security, and a social slideshow karaoke. The most popular event of all was "Take a Break with Roblox", in which hackers could socialize with each other and the mentors from Roblox over a cup of boba from a local tea shop.

## Tech Impact / Diversity

Due to COVID, there hadn't been such a large hackathon in Wisconsin since 2019. So a driving goal of MadHacks 2023 was to make it as welcoming and enriching as possible for those with little hackathon or programming experience. To that end, we had 20 incredible mentors on site, with diverse backgrounds and expertise. Given the abnormally high number of first-time hackers and projects relative to the total number of attendees, we consider our goal achieved!

## Impact of GitHub Grant

Almost every team utilized GitHub to collaboratively and efficiently work on their projects over the 24-hours. The GitHub grant helped fund snacks and drinks throughout the event, which helped participants stay fueled, excited, and engaged. It's obvious from the event's project turnout that participants were extremely engaged, showing double the amount of completed projects than was expected for an event of our size.
