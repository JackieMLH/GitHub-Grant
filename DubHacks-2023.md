# DubHacks 2023
 <br>
 
#### October 14 - 15, 2023 
#### University of Washington
#### Seattle, WA, USA 

## Event Summary
DubHacks was 2 days of hacking, helping our audience grow their career skills, and work towards their first job or internship. We saw hundreds of hackers from all over North America join us for a variety of mini-events, workshops, and other programming to help them learn more about tech.
<br>
Throughout the weekend hackers were encouraged to work on projects that would advance tomorrow in our tracks of Synergy, Vitality, and Disruption. There’s a summary of some of our top projects down below. Our workshops included topics in Blockchain, Health Technology, and a Bob Ross painting session.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
DubHacks targeted hackers from all backgrounds in North America looking to get started on their careers in tech. Over 30% of the attendees were relatively new to coding and benefitted from their attendance at DubHacks. We provided a community of support and resources necessary to succeed. We had a gender parity of 35% women and 65% men.

## Top Projects

We had tons of amazing projects at DubHacks, but we did need to narrow it down and select some top projects to award prizes to. Some of our favorite projects were;

- [StreetSmart](https://devpost.com/software/streetsmart-hb7oxi) - Provides the safest routes for users to go from one place to another.
- [Thunder Struct](https://devpost.com/software/thunder-struct-vr-tutorial) - A coding tutorial implemented on VR.
- [EdPop](https://devpost.com/software/edpop) - Accessible in-person learning through direct-to-consumer location-based classes.

## What’s Next?
DubHacks is an annual hackathon. Our next hackathon will likely take place October 2024. With the funds from GitHub, we were able to focus on our continued work in our community and will keep growing via our social platform on Instagram at @dubhacks_
